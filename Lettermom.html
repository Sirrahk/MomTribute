          The day you left this earth was and still is the hardest day of my life. I didnt think I would be 33 and mother less but alas here I am. I've had a rough time, since you've been gone, a lot of things just don't make sense! But I know you're guiding me and even building this page was at the hands of your guidance. I'm trying to remember what you taught me, that where there's a will there's a way. Trying to remember our last mother daughter trip, just two weeks before. But at the end of each day, the you sized whole in my soul aches. Aches for the future memories that could've been, the grandmother (when it's time) you would've been, and the mom/best friend that you were. Yet and still, I know, that I will be ok.  <span class = "emphasis"> I thank you for so much that you taught me but most importantly for being the best mother ever! I love you and will never stop thinking about you. Continue to watch over me </span>
