      <p class="tagline">A beginner Coder that is!</p>

      <p class = "aboutme"> After a series of unfourtanate events, I decided that it was now or never! 
        It all started back in July 2019, I came across an instagram add for Colombia's School of Engineering Data Scienece bootcamp. After doing the initial interview that interviewer told me that I may be more suited for the Web Developmet bootcamp. 
        Not knowing anything about bootcamps or even what I actually wanted to do coding wise, I jumped right in. WRONG DECISION. I wasn't focused nor was I in the space to embark on this journey. Soooo needless to say, I failed, with flying colors. Time and money wasted (Because some bootcamps are not on the cheap side).
        Now, months later, with a renewed sense of self, purpose and drive. I am ready to take it on again. This time I researched, joined groups, and even found a mentor. I decided to document my journey.
